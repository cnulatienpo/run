# RunnyVision

RunnyVision is a playful dual-mode experience that pairs a runner view with a creator studio. Fake-but-feels-real miles turn step counts into epic voyages.

## Getting started

### Backend
```bash
cd runnyvision/backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Backend runs on http://localhost:4000

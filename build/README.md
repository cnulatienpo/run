# Installer assets

Place your Windows installer resources in this directory before running `electron-builder`.

Required files:

- `icon.ico` – application icon for the generated installer
- `installerSplash.bmp` – 164x314 BMP image shown in the NSIS sidebar

These files are not committed to source control; supply your own branding assets locally.
